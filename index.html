            <p class="outlineText text">We aim to reveal not just ownership trends, but also how companion animals shape
                people’s
                lifestyles, communities, and daily choices.</p>
            <p class="outlineText text">The visualisation moves from macro to micro, starting with national ownership
                rates
                and
                geographic differences, and drilling down to pet acquisition methods, ownership motivations, income
                patterns, and barriers faced by future pet owners.</p>
            <p class="outlineText text">Our primary dataset is the Companion Animals New Zealand Pet Data Report 2024,
                based

                        Zealand, based on
                        household survey data.</p>

                    <p class="text">Households in the Rest of the North Island are the most likely to own a dog
                        (38%).</p>

                    <p class="text">Auckland has the lowest dog ownership rate (24%), which is significantly lower than
                        other
                        regions. Cat ownership follows a similar pattern.</p>

                    <p class="text">Rest of the North Island leads with 46% of households owning a cat. Auckland again
                        shows the
                        lowest ownership rate at 35%.</p>

                    <p class="text">Households in the Rest of the South Island report equal ownership rates for cats and
                        dogs, both
                        at 36%.</p>

                    <p class="text">The sample sizes for each region vary and may influence the statistical reliability
                        of the pet
                        ownership rates presented. In particular:</p>

                    <p class="text">Regions with larger base sizes—such as Rest of the North Island (n=666) and Auckland
                        (n=627)—provide stronger confidence in the reported trends.</p>

                    <p class="text">However, regions with smaller sample sizes (such as Rest of South Island and
                        Canterbury) may have
                        wider margins of error, and their reported percentages should be interpreted with caution.</p>

                    commonly
                    obtained through animal rescue organisations, particularly the SPCA (22%). 16% of cats were found or
                    adopted as strays, compared to just 1% of dogs, both suggesting cats are more commonly acquired
                    informally or opportunistically.</p>
                <p class="text">While dogs are most frequently acquired from breeders (34%) or via private
                    advertisements (21%),
                    indicating more formal and commercial acquisition patterns. Informal networks (e.g. friends, family,
                    neighbours) also play a key role in both cat and dog acquisition.</p>

                    perceived cost (48% of respondents) and time commitments (49% of respondents). Also mentioned were
                    concerns about responsibility (36% of respondents). About 29% of respondents cited messiness (such
                    as fur or dirt) as a reason, while 24% avoided pets due to the sadness they might experience when
                    the animal passes away. </p>
                <p class="text">These reasons highlight that emotional and sensory sensitivities—rather than purely

To get this data, 500 terms based on autocomplete data were combined with 5,000 questions about dogs, and 5,000 about cats, from Google Trends query data. This was filtered to include only results that started with six specific questions -- Why does a cat/dog, Why do cats/dogs, Why is a cat/dog, Why are cats/dogs, Why does my cat/dog and, Why is my cat/dog. Finally, this data was normalized, and indexed to 100.</p>
                        <p class="text bottomText">During the data analysis, sentence trees were created by splitting each question into the separate words, and combining sentences that shared the initial part of their sentence. Splitting up a "branch" whenever the sentences would start to differ. Using the sentence tree based data, the most common topics for cats and dogs became apparent.</p>
