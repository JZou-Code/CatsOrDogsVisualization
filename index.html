                interactive
                web-based visualisation.</p>
            <p class="outlineText text">We aim to reveal not just ownership trends, but also how companion animals shape
                people’s
                lifestyles, communities, and daily choices.</p>
            <p class="outlineText text">The visualisation moves from macro to micro, starting with national ownership
                rates
                and
                geographic differences, and drilling down to pet acquisition methods, ownership motivations, income
                patterns, and barriers faced by future pet owners.</p>
            <p class="outlineText text">Our primary dataset is the Companion Animals New Zealand Pet Data Report 2024,
                based
                on a

                        Zealand, based on
                        household survey data.</p>

                    <p class="text">Households in the Rest of the North Island are the most likely to own a dog
                        (38%).</p>

                    <p class="text">Auckland has the lowest dog ownership rate (24%), which is significantly lower than
                        other
                        regions. Cat ownership follows a similar pattern.</p>

                    <p class="text">Rest of the North Island leads with 46% of households owning a cat. Auckland again
                        shows the
                        lowest ownership rate at 35%.</p>

                    <p class="text">Households in the Rest of the South Island report equal ownership rates for cats and
                        dogs, both
                        at 36%.</p>

                    <p class="text">The sample sizes for each region vary and may influence the statistical reliability
                        of the pet
                        ownership rates presented. In particular:</p>

                    <p class="text">Regions with larger base sizes—such as Rest of the North Island (n=666) and Auckland
                        (n=627)—provide stronger confidence in the reported trends.</p>

                    <p class="text">However, regions with smaller sample sizes (such as Rest of South Island and
                        Canterbury) may have
                        wider margins of error, and their reported percentages should be interpreted with caution.</p>

                    years.</p>

                <p class="text">we do not see a significant change in the cat population. It is estimated that there are
                    approximately 1.26 million companion cats.</p>

                <p class="text">The ways in which New Zealanders acquire cats and dogs differ notably. Cats are most commonly
                    obtained through animal rescue organisations, particularly the SPCA (22%). 16% of cats were found or
                    adopted as strays, compared to just 1% of dogs, both suggesting cats are more commonly acquired
                    informally or opportunistically.</p>
                <p class="text">While dogs are most frequently acquired from breeders (34%) or via private advertisements (21%),
                    indicating more formal and commercial acquisition patterns. Informal networks (e.g. friends, family,
                    neighbours) also play a key role in both cat and dog acquisition.</p>
